## Go-Funcs

Some utility shell script functions useful in the go development environment


## Installation

To use shell functions, download and exec the shell script.

```sh
$ go get github.com/sikang99/go-funcs
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sikang99/go-funcs
$ source ./go-funcs.sh # or include . <path>/go-funcs.sh in ~/.bashrc
```

### Usage

To see help message of usage after installation, 

```sh
$ usage
usage: goto [.|..|root|path|stoney|wasm|webcam|http]
usage: goget [<option>] <package path>
usage: gopath <package name>
usage: gohub <search text>
usage: gover <go version>
```

To change a specific directory, use `goto`.

```sh
$ goto
usage: goto [.|..|root|path|stoney|wasm|webcam|http]

$ goto . # save the current directory
$ goto .. # return to the saved directory
```

To download go sources from open repos, use `goget` regardless of includng http scheme or .git tail.

```sh
$ goget
usage: goget [<option>] <package path>

$ goget https://github.com/sikang99/go-funcs.git
$ goget https;//github.com/sikang99/go-funcs -u
$ goget github.com/sikang99/go-funcs/... -u -v
$ goget -u github.com/sikang99/go-funcs/... -v
$ pwd
GOPATH/src/github.com/sikang99/go-funcs
```

To change to the directory that you check the go sources downloaded, use `gopath` as following.  
`/vendor` and `/_` directories are excluded in search

```sh
$ gopath
usage: gopath <package name>

$ gopath go-funcs
GOPATH/src/github.com/sikang99/go-funcs

$ gopath github.com
GOPATH/src/github.com
```

To use `gohub`, install the package [sikang99/hub-search](https://github.com/sikang99/go-funcs).

```sh
$ goget https://github.com/sikang99/go-funcs
$ gohub
usage: gohub <search text>

To select a specific go version installed in your environment, 
use `gover` with version number such as 1,9, 1.10, 1.11
Currently my case with two go versions is as following. 
If your want to support more versions, plz edit the script. 

```sh
$ tree -L 1 $GOROOT/..
$HOME/root/go/..
├── bak
├── go -> go1.11beta2
├── go1.9.7
├── go1.10.3
└── go1.11beta3
```

Let's try to use `gover`.

```sh
$ gover
usage: gover <go version>

$ gover 1.10 # or 1.9, 1.10.3, go1.10.3
go version go1.10.3 linux/amd64

$ gover 1.11
go version go1.11beta3 linux/amd64
```
